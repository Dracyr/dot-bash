## Dot files.

### Install
    curl https://raw.github.com/buren/dot-bash/master/setup.sh | bash

#### Notes
  Breaks ` ` `tree` ` ` , will always target current folder and pipe output to ` ` `less` ` ` . For normal usage, use ` ` `\tree` ` `
 
 
  Some of the aliases are Ubuntu specific, others use ` ` `apt-get ` ` ` .
